# None-Plainar-Slicing 

## Introduction
This project enables slicing of G-code for non-planar 3D printing. The process involves three main steps:

1. **Preprocessing the Mesh:** Prepare the mesh model for slicing.
2. **Slicing the Mesh:** Slice the mesh using any regular slicing technique.
3. **Postprocessing the G-code:** Finalize the G-code for non-planar printing.

This workflow ensures that G-code is accurately generated for complex, non-planar printing tasks.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the None-Plainar-Slicing project.
Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

          Python 3.8 or higher
          Git

### Steps
#### 1) Clone the repository:
Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

         git clone https://github.com/q4yz/None-Plainar-Slicing.git
         cd None-Plainar-Slicing

#### 2) Set up a virtual environment:
Create a virtual environment to manage your dependencies:

         python -m venv myenv

#### 3) Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:

         myenv\Scripts\activate



#### 4) Install the required dependencies:

With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages using pip:

         python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

#### 5) Run the main script:

Execute the main script to start the project:

         python "Transformer v2/main.py"

#### Notes
Ensure your terminal is in the None-Plainar-Slicing directory when running the commands.
If you encounter any issues related to missing dependencies, make sure all required packages are listed in requirements.txt and installed.

## Usage 

This project enables slicing of G-code for non-planar 3D printing. The process involves three main steps:

    - Preprocessing the Mesh: Prepare the mesh model for slicing.
    - Slicing the Mesh: Slice the mesh using any regular slicing software.
    - Postprocessing the G-code: Finalize the G-code for non-planar printing.

This workflow ensures that G-code is accurately generated for complex, non-planar printing tasks.
