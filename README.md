# None-Plainar-Slicing 

## Introduction
This project enables slicing of G-code for non-planar 3D printing. The process involves three main steps:

1. **Preprocessing the Mesh:** Prepare the mesh model for slicing.
2. **Slicing the Mesh:** Slice the mesh using any regular slicing technique.
3. **Postprocessing the G-code:** Finalize the G-code for non-planar printing.

This workflow ensures that G-code is accurately generated for complex, non-planar printing tasks.

## Installation

To get started with the None-Plainar-Slicing project, follow these steps:
